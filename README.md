Understanding Society data are used to generate the core results for the paper, although the British Household Panel Survey is used to corrobate some parts of the analysis. 
Code to replicate the creation of the key variables and all the analysis in both Understanding Society and the British Household Panel Survey are uploaded here. 
We have also made available the R code necessary to replicate the Latent Class Analysis.
